        at &lt;a href=\"/r/worldnews\"&gt;/r/worldnews&lt;/a&gt;, readers often report
        certain sites to the moderators, asking them to ban them for their sensationalized
        articles. Wanting to avoid an outright ban, moderators asked me to test an
        idea: what is the effect of encouraging skepticism and fact-checking on frequently-unreliable
        news sources? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We wanted to see how the &lt;a href=\"/r/worldnews\"&gt;r/worldnews&lt;/a&gt;
        community would respond, and we also wondered what the effect might be on
        reddit&amp;#39;s rankings. In a study of sticky comments from Nov 27 to Jan
        20, here&amp;#39;s the TLDR:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within
        discussions of tabloid submissions on &lt;a href=\"/r/worldnews\"&gt;r/worldnews&lt;/a&gt;,
        &lt;strong&gt;encouraging fact-checking increases the incidence rate of comments
        with links by 2x on average&lt;/strong&gt;, and encouraging fact-checking
        + voting has a similar effect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On
        average, &lt;strong&gt;sticky comments encouraging fact-checking caused a
        2x reduction in the reddit score of tabloid submissions after 24 hours&lt;/strong&gt;,
        a statistically-significant effect that likely influenced rankings in the
        subreddit. Where sticky comments included an added encouragement to vote,
        I did not find a statistically-significant effect (though other models did)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can
        Sticky Comments Encourage Fact-Checking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With
        over 15 million subscribers, &lt;a href=\"/r/worldnews\"&gt;r/worldnews&lt;/a&gt;
        readers have a pretty huge capacity to fact-check stories. Moderators hoped
        that if they asked, some redditors would help out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For
        this test, we A/B tested two different sticky comments\u2013messages that
        we pinned to the top of a discussion. The first one encourages people to fact-check
        the news link:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/E9oWq4v.png\"&gt;http://imgur.com/E9oWq4v.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The
        second encourages people to fact-check the article and consider downvoting
        the link if they can&amp;#39;t find supporting evidence for its claims:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a
        href=\"http://imgur.com/YbFVaXl.png\"&gt;http://imgur.com/YbFVaXl.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moderators
        created a list of tabloid news sources (&lt;a href=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/mitmedialab/CivilServant-Analysis/1fc969e5/reports/sticky_comment_experiment_results_worldnews.01.31.2017.html#how-we-tested-the-effect-of-our-sticky-comments\"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt;),
        and from Nov 27 to Jan 20, we randomly assigned each new tabloid link to one
        of three conditions: (1) no sticky comment, (1) a sticky comment encouraging
        skepticism, (2) a sticky comment encouraging skepticism + voting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In
        a negative binomial model (&lt;a href=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/mitmedialab/CivilServant-Analysis/1fc969e5/reports/sticky_comment_experiment_results_worldnews.01.31.2017.html#the-effect-of-sticky-comments-on-fact-checking-behavior\"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt;),
        the note encouraging fact-checking increases the incidence rate of link-bearing
        comments by 2.01x on average, and the note encouraging skepticism and downvotes
        increases the incidence rate by 2.03x on average, among tabloid links on &lt;a
        href=\"/r/worldnews\"&gt;r/worldnews&lt;/a&gt;. Both results are statistically
        significant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/EcVXAvS.png\"&gt;http://imgur.com/EcVXAvS.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can
        Sticky Comments Influence How reddit&amp;#39;s Algorithms See Unreliable News?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While
        we were confident that &lt;a href=\"/r/worldnews\"&gt;r/worldnews&lt;/a&gt;
        readers would help out if moderators asked, we also worried that increasing
        commenting activity around tabloid news might accidentally cause reddit&amp;#39;s
        algorithms to notice and promote those tabloid links. If fact-checking increased
        the popularity of unreliable news sources, the community might need to rethink
        where to put their effort. That&amp;#39;s why moderators tested the sticky
        comment that encourages readers to consider downvoting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To
        test the effects on reddit&amp;#39;s algorithms, I collected data on the score
        of posts every four minutes. The platform doesn&amp;#39;t publish exactly
        what goes into the score or exactly how its rankings work (I asked). However,
        we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; predict the subreddit HOT page ranking of a post
        from its age and score (&lt;a href=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/mitmedialab/CivilServant-Analysis/1fc969e5/reports/sticky_comment_experiment_results_worldnews.01.31.2017.html#outcome-variables\"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt;).
        Basically, if fact-checking had a large effect on an article&amp;#39;s score,
        then it probably had an effect on an article&amp;#39;s ranking over time on
        the subreddit page (and perhaps elsewhere too).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As reddit&amp;#39;s
        algorithms currently stand, encouraging fact-checking caused tabloid submissions
        to receive 49.1% (2.04x less) the score of submissions with no sticky comment,
        after 24 hours, on average in &lt;a href=\"/r/worldnews\"&gt;r/worldnews&lt;/a&gt;.
        The effect is statistically-significant. In this negative binomial model,
        I failed to find an effect from the sticky comments that encouraged readers
        to consider downvoting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/oAWfFwF.png\"&gt;http://imgur.com/oAWfFwF.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The
        full picture is slightly more complex. Encouraging voting does have a small
        positive effect on the growth rate of score over time, as I found in a longitudinal
        analysis that predicted an article&amp;#39;s score at a moment in time. The
        effect of these sticky comments on reddit&amp;#39;s algorithms may also have
        changed after &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5gvd6b/scores_on_posts_are_about_to_start_going_up/\"&gt;reddit
        adjusted its algorithms in early December&lt;/a&gt;. These charts focus on
        the period after the adjustment (&lt;a href=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/mitmedialab/CivilServant-Analysis/1fc969e5/reports/sticky_comment_experiment_results_worldnews.01.31.2017.html#the-effect-of-sticky-comments-on-reddits-algorithms\"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a
        href=\"http://imgur.com/xOs9ZrE.png\"&gt;http://imgur.com/xOs9ZrE.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who
        Commented?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of 930 non-bot comments with
        links that moderators allowed to remain, there were 737 unique commenters.
        Out of these, 133 accounts made more than one comment with links. Many people
        fact-checked their own submissions, with submitters posting 81 comments to
        further information. Thanks everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What
        Don&amp;#39;t We Know?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This test looks
        at outcomes within discussions rather than individual accounts, so I can&amp;#39;t
        know if individual people were convinced to be more skeptical, or if the sticky
        comments caused already-skeptical people to investigate and share. I also
        don&amp;#39;t have any evidence on whether the fact-checking had an effect
        on readers, although other research suggests it might [1] [2]. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would
        this work with other kinds of links, in other subreddits, or on other sites?
        This study is limited to a specific community and list of sites. While I suspect
        that many large online communities of readers would help fact-check links
        if moderators asked, our findings about the reddit algorithm are much more
        situated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, this study might be the first &amp;quot;AI
        Nudge&amp;quot; to systematically test the effect of pro-social community
        efforts to influence a algorithmic system out in the world. I&amp;#39;m grateful
        to &lt;a href=\"/r/worldnews\"&gt;r/worldnews&lt;/a&gt; moderators for asking
